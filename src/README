This is an experimental Unified Installer for Nova. 

This is targeted at the Bexar release and will come standard with support for 
Centos 5.5, RHEL 5.5, and Ubuntu 10.04/10.10. 

The package dependencies, install flow, configuration flow, and distribution
specific commands are read from a manifest file that is formated JSON.

The global manifest file named "manifest.global" lists the supported 
distributions and releases along with providing a base file name for the
distribution specific manifests "manifest.<distribution>.<release>"
